Overview of the Hotel Booking Form Project
This project is about creating a simple and user-friendly web form that allows customers to book rooms in a hotel. The form captures essential details from the customer, calculates the total cost of their stay based on their selections, and shows the remaining balance after any advance payment. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Customer Information:

The form collects the customer's name, check-in date, the number of days they will stay, the total number of persons, and the advance payment amount.
Room Selection:

The customer can choose between two types of rooms: Delux or Suite.
They can also select additional amenities like AC (air conditioning) and a Locker.
Cost Calculation:

Room rates and amenities rates are predefined (e.g., Delux Room costs 3000 per day, Suite Room costs 5000 per day, AC costs 1000 per day, and Locker costs 500 per day).
The form automatically calculates the total cost based on the selected room type, amenities, and the number of days.
If there are more than two persons, extra person charges are added (1000 per day for each extra person).
Payment and Balance:

The form calculates the total cost and subtracts the advance payment to show the remaining balance that the customer needs to pay.
Key Features
User-friendly Interface: Easy-to-use form for entering booking details.
Automatic Calculations: Total cost and balance are calculated automatically.
Mandatory Fields: Ensures all necessary information is provided before booking.
This project is implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic and calculations.
